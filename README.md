# BoulderBody 🧗

A web application for tracking bouldering sessions with intelligent recommendations based on your performance.

## Features

- ✨ **Smart Recommendations** - Get level suggestions based on your fail rate and time since last session
- 📊 **Session Tracking** - Log boulder attempts as Flash/Done/Fail
- 📈 **Visual Analytics** - See your performance with interactive donut charts
- ⏱️ **Time Tracking** - Track session duration automatically
- 🌓 **Theme Toggle** - Switch between light and dark modes
- 💾 **Offline Storage** - All data saved locally in your browser (no backend required)

## Live Demo

## How It Works

### Recommendation Algorithm

The app suggests your next session's difficulty level based on:

1. **Performance Adjustment**
   - Fail rate < 25% → increase level by 1
   - Fail rate > 75% → decrease level by 1
   - Otherwise → keep same level

2. **Time Decay**
   - 8-14 days since last session → decrease level by 1
   - More than 14 days → decrease level by 2
   - Less than 8 days → no change

3. **Level Clamping**
   - Minimum level is always 1

### Fail Rate Calculation

Unlogged boulders count as fails (stricter approach). This encourages you to log all attempts and provides a more honest assessment of performance.

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
